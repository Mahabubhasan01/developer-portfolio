            <p>. “Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work.
             I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it will pay 
                off. It could be inar year it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off.” — Kevin Hart</p>

                <p>Your baby will be growing and developing rapidly now. They are <br>learning more about the world and how they fit into it. Many of the new things your baby is learning at 5 months are preparing them for eating solid food. It is usually recommended you introduce solids at 6 months, but some babies are ready as early as 4 months. So, if you think it's time, it's fine to start experimenting with solids now.
